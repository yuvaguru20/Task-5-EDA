# Task-5-EDA

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to uncover patterns influencing passenger survival. Using Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib), the analysis explores relationships between factors like age, class, gender, and fare. Visualizations such as histograms, boxplots, heatmaps, and pairplots help identify key trends. The findings highlight that survival was strongly affected by gender, passenger class, and fare.
